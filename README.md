# AR-Delhi-Tourist-Map

Introduction
The Augmented Reality (AR) Delhi Tour Guide Application is a cutting-edge mobile application
developed using Unity and Vuforia, designed to enhance the experience of tourists and students
exploring the historical and cultural landmarks of Delhi, India. This innovative AR application
leverages the power of mobile devices to provide users with an immersive and interactive way to
explore Delhi's rich heritage. It is useful for tourists visiting Delhi for the first time, as well as for
students in schools who are learning about the state's history.
Purpose and Objectives
The primary purpose of the AR Delhi Tour Guide Application is to offer tourists and students a
unique and engaging way to discover the historical monuments of Delhi. The key objectives of
this project are:
1. Augmented Reality Experience: Enable users to view 3D representations of Delhi's
famous monuments directly on their phone's camera when pointed at a map of Delhi.
2. Interactive Information: Provide users with detailed information about each
monument, including its name, a brief history, and architectural significance, through
interactive audio clips.
3. Educational Value: Cater to both tourists and students by offering educational content
that complements academic learning while touring the city.
Design Process And Background Studies:
I conducted a comprehensive research to understand the tourism industry in Delhi, including
the needs and preferences of tourists, and realised that the number of tourists in Delhi is
significantly lower than the capital cities of other countries. There was a gap between what was
usually offered and what the tourists wanted. I also researched the educational sector to identify
how students could benefit from this application in their studies. I found that understanding the
historical significance of heritage cultural sites and finding engaging educational content were a
few pain points for tourists and students, respectively.
While ideating solutions about these issues, I brainstormed ideas of historical re-enactments
through AR, multilingual support for tourists and students as well as AR for museums. Finally, I
shortlisted the idea of the map with monuments in AR as it seemed unique and caters to both
tourists and students. I then implemented the idea using Unity. To make it more interactive, I

added a tap option on the monuments which would play an audio clip recorded by me giving a
brief history of the monument. This created the application more interactive and engaging.
Features
1. AR Mapping: Users can open the application and point their phone's camera at a
physical map of Delhi. The 3D representations of famous monuments appear on the map
based on their real-world locations. These monuments are accurately positioned on the
map, offering a visually immersive experience.
1. Interactive Monument Information: Users can access detailed information upon
tapping a monument on the AR map. A small audio clip is played, providing users with
the monument's name and a brief historical overview.
Technologies Used
The AR Delhi Tour Guide Application was developed using the following technologies:
1. Unity 3D: The core platform for building the AR experience.
2. Vuforia: Augmented reality engine for marker-based tracking.
3. C#: Programming language used for developing interactive features.
